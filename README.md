## ðŸªµ Well hello!

I'm a part time __indie developer__ who does a bit of everything. I create __open source__ projects that focus on *quality*, *minimalism* and *user experience* such as the ones you'll find below :)

âœ¨ Check out my latest projects: [My Favorite Dogs](https://github.com/morceaudebois/myfavoritedogs), [Apollo the Parrot ðŸ¦œ](https://github.com/morceaudebois/apollo_parrot) & [Debrandify](https://github.com/morceaudebois/debrandify)!

I also remade [my website](https://tahoe.be) recently ðŸ™Œ

Thank you for passing by, see ya!
